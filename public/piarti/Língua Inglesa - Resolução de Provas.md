Green Intelligence: Why Data And Al Must Become More Sustainable

Bernard Marr

Mar 22, 2023

As big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence continue to gain
prominence in
information technology, experts are raising concerns about the environmental
costs of
computation — primarily data and Al's carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions.

The problem is showing no signs of slowing down. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, data
and Al deployment increased exponentially as the demand for digital transformation increased.


MIT reported that the cloud now has a larger carbon footprint than the entire airline
industry,
and a single data center might consume an amount of electricity equivalent to 50,000 homes.

Meanwhile, the datasets used to train Al are increasingly large and take an enormous amount of
energy to run. The MIT Technology Review reported that training just one Al model can
emit
more than 626,00 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent - which is nearly five times the
lifetime
emissions of an average American car.

Let's take a look at why it's important for enterprises to address how data storage
and Al are
contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and what we can do to mitigate the impacts
of this
ongoing problem.

Why We Must Address This Problem

Sanjay Podder, managing director and global lead of technology sustainability innovation
at
Accenture, says that the exponential growth in data and its increased energy demand
could
actually counteract and impede our global progress on climate change.

Right now, the Al community has adopted a "bigger is better" attitude regarding data
and
artificial intelligence - but that approach threatens to inflict major environmental
damage in the
future.

Tech experts will need to expend greater and greater amounts of energy to build
increasingly
larger models, with decreasing improvements in performance.

For example, the Al that underlies autonomous vehicles must be trained to learn to drive. Once
the initial training is complete, the Al model in the autonomous vehicle performs
continuous
inference so it can navigate its environment. This process happens day after day as long as we
are using the vehicle. That's a lot of energy requirements just for one car.

We need bold, thoughtful initiatives to set the field of Al on a more sustainable trajectory.

Suggestions for Tackling Al's Sustainability Impact

What can enterprise companies do to mitigate the environmental impacts of Al and big
data
while still driving forward with innovation? Here are a few data sustainability suggestions:


Consider how environmental impact is measured. We need to improve
carbon
accounting by delivering faster, more accurate data on carbon footprints and
sustainability
impacts. Tools like Salesforce's Net Zero Cloud, SustainLife, and Microsoft
Cloud for
Sustainability can help companies visualize and understand their missteps so they can
spot
opportunities for improvement.

Estimate carbon footprints of Al models. The Machine Learning Emissions Calculator can
help practitioners run estimations based on factors like cloud provider, geographic
region, and
hardware.

Examine how and where data is stored. Some of the biggest machine learning jobs might
be moved to more carbon-friendly regions of the world. For example, Montreal, Canada
has a
number of data centers that run on hydroelectricity.

Increase transparency and measurement. As Al researchers publish their results for new
models, they should include measurements of how much energy was emitted in their model,
right alongside their performance and accuracy metrics.

Follow Google's "4M" best practices. Google has identified four best practices, known as
the "4Ms," that can significantly reduce energy and carbon emissions for anyone using
Google
Cloud services. These include selecting efficient machine learning model architectures,
using
processors and systems optimized for ML training, computing in the cloud rather than
on-
premise, and map optimization to choose locations with the cleanest energy. By following these
practices, Google claims, energy can be reduced by 100x and emissions by 1000x.

How to Work Toward New Al Paradigms

As we continue to see the accelerated adoption of Al and machine learning technologies
into
our society, we must consider what these tools and systems are doing to our
environment.
Unless we are willing to reform today's Al research agenda and increase transparency around this
issue, the world of Al could hold us back in the fight to slow down climate change.

Green Intelligence: Why Data And Al Must Become More Sustainable

Inteligência Verde: Por Que os Dados e a IA Devem Se Tornar Mais Sustentáveis

22 de Março, 2023

As big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence continue to gain
prominence in
information technology, experts are raising concerns about the environmental
costs of
computation — primarily data and Al's carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions.

À medida que o big data, o aprendizado de máquina e a inteligência artificial (IA) continuam a
ganhar destaque na tecnologia da informação, os especialistas estão expressando preocupação
sobre os custos ambientais da computação — principalmente dados e a emissão de carbono e as
emissões de gases de efeito estufa da IA.

The problem is showing no signs of slowing down. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, data
and Al deployment increased exponentially as the demand for digital transformation
increased.
MIT reported that the cloud now has a larger carbon footprint than the entire airline
industry,
and a single data center might consume an amount of electricity equivalent to 50,000 homes.

O problema é não mostrar sinais de desaceleração. Como resultado da pandemia da COVID-19,
a implantação de dados e IA aumentaram exponencialmente à medida que cresceu a demanda
por transformação digital. O MIT informou que a nuvem agora tem uma emissão de carbono
maior do que toda a indústria aérea, e um único data center pode consumir uma quantidade de
eletricidade equivalente a 50.000 residências.

Meanwhile, the datasets used to train Al are increasingly large and take an enormous amount of
energy to run. The MIT Technology Review reported that training just one Al model can
emit
more than 626,00 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent - which is nearly five times the
lifetime
emissions of an average American car.

Enquanto isso, os conjuntos de dados usados para treinar a IA são cada vez maiores e
consomem uma enorme quantidade de energia para serem executados. A revista do Instituto de
Tecnologia de Massachusetts (MIT Technology Review) informou que o treinamento de apenas
um modelo de IA pode emitir mais de 626,00 libras de dióxido de carbono equivalente - o que é
quase cinco vezes as emissões de vida de um típico carro americano.

Let's take a look at why it's important for enterprises to address how data storage
and Al are
contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and what we can do to mitigate the impacts
of this
ongoing problem.

Vamos dar uma olhada no motivo pelo qual é importante que as empresas abordem como o
armazenamento de dados e a IA estão contribuindo para as emissões de gases de efeito estufa e
o que podemos fazer para mitigar os impactos desse problema contínuo.

Why We Must Address This Problem
Por Que Devemos Abordar Esse Problema

Sanjay Podder, managing director and global lead of technology sustainability innovation
at
Accenture, says that the exponential growth in data and its increased energy demand
could
actually counteract and impede our global progress on climate change.

Sanjay Podder, diretor administrativo e líder global de inovação em sustentabilidade tecnológica
da Accenture, diz que o crescimento exponencial dos dados e o aumento da demanda de
energia podem realmente contrariar e impedir nosso progresso global em relação às mudanças
climáticas.

Right now, the Al community has adopted a "bigger is better" attitude regarding data
and
artificial intelligence - but that approach threatens to inflict major environmental
damage in the
future.


Neste momento, a comunidade de IA adotou uma atitude de "maior é melhor" em relação a
dados e inteligência artificial - mas essa abordagem ameaça infligir grandes danos ambientais no
futuro.

Tech experts will need to expend greater and greater amounts of energy to build
increasingly
larger models, with decreasing improvements in performance.

Os especialistas em tecnologia precisarão gastar cada vez mais energia para construir modelos
cada vez maiores, com melhorias decrescentes no desempenho.

For example, the Al that underlies autonomous vehicles must be trained to learn to drive. Once
the initial training is complete, the Al model in the autonomous vehicle performs
continuous
inference so it can navigate its environment. This process happens day after day as long as we
are using the vehicle. That's a lot of energy requirements just for one car.

Por exemplo, a IA que é utilizada em veículos autônomos deve ser treinada para
aprender a
dirigir. Uma vez que o treinamento inicial é concluído, o modelo de IA no veículo
autônomo
realiza inferência contínua para que ele possa navegar em seu ambiente. Esse processo acontece
dia após dia, enquanto estivermos usando o veículo. São muitos requisitos de energia
apenas
para um carro.

We need bold, thoughtful initiatives to set the field of Al on a more sustainable trajectory.

Precisamos de iniciativas ousadas e ponderadas para colocar o campo da IA em uma trajetória
mais sustentável.

Suggestions for Tackling Al's Sustainability Impact
Sugestões para Lidar com o Impacto da IA na Sustentabilidade

What can enterprise companies do to mitigate the environmental impacts of Al and big
data
while still driving forward with innovation? Here are a few data sustainability suggestions:

O que as empresas podem fazer para mitigar os impactos ambientais da IA e do Big Data e, ao
mesmo tempo, avançar com a inovação? Aqui estão algumas sugestões de sustentabilidade de
dados:


Consider how environmental impact is measured. We need to improve
carbon

Examine como e onde os dados são armazenados. Alguns dos maiores trabalhos de
aprendizado de máquina podem ser transferidos para regiões do mundo mais favoráveis ao
carbono. Por exemplo, Montreal, no Canadá, tem vários data centers que funcionam com
hidroeletricidade.

Increase transparency and measurement. As Al researchers publish their results for new
models, they should include measurements of how much energy was emitted in their model,
right alongside their performance and accuracy metrics.

Aumentar a transparência e a medição. À medida que os pesquisadores de IA publicam
seus resultados para novos modelos, eles devem incluir medições da quantidade de energia
emitida em seu modelo, juntamente com suas métricas de desempenho e precisão.

uso de
processadores e sistemas otimizados para treinamento de aprendizado de máquina,
a
computação na nuvem em vez de no local e a otimização de mapas para escolher locais com a
energia mais limpa. Segundo o Google, ao seguir essas práticas, a energia pode ser reduzida em
100 vezes e as emissões em 1000 vezes.

Insights and Advocacy Manager, ClimateTech
Friday 21 April, 2023

Saturday, 22 April 2023 marks Earth Day, with the theme 'Invest in our planet'. To
mark the
occasion, this blog considers the role of digital technology in protecting natural
resources and
presents recommendations for designing, and investing in, high impact solutions.

It was co-written by the GSMA ClimateTech and FCDO-funded Reversing
Environmental
Degradation in África and Asia (REDAA) programmes.

Earth Day reminds us of the urgent need to protect natural resources and preserve
them for
future generations

Biodiversity loss is a rapidly escalating crisis, with up to one million species facing the threat
of
extinction. Human activities have significantly altered 75% of the world's land surface
and
resulted in the loss of over 85% of wetlands. The degradation of nature has dire consequences
for human welfare, including the provision of food, water and livelihood security,
undermining
society's ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

For generations, Indigenous people and local communities have taken on the crucial role
of
being the primary guardians of our planet's natural resources. Despite comprising just 6% of the
global population, they are responsible for safeguarding 80% of the worlcTs biodiversity. Yet, the
impact of exploiting our earth's finite natural resources are disproportionately borne
by these
local guardians, making inequality worse.

Digital solutions: A useful tool for nature and people - if used wisely

Digital technology offers significant potential to address these urgent environmental and
social
challenges. But too often, well-intended digital tech fails to help local people or reach the scale
needed to create positive impact on both people and nature. A new report by the GSMA
ClimateTech and FCDO-funded Reversing Environmental Degradation in África and Asia
(REDAA) programmes explores barriers and opportunities to such solutions. It outlines practical
steps for more digital technology to realise its potential in helping nature and
people thrive
together.

We found strong examples of communities using digital technologies to manage
natural
resources better. These solutions are diverse: from the use of big data to predict
air pollution
and restore mangroves, to engaging mobile apps that provide better information and
access to
finance to help local people plan and manage natural resources, through to GPS technology and
remote sensing to track and protect wildlife. The report draws inspiration from three case studies
where digital technologies have made positive social and environmental changes:

* Composite Landscape Assessment and Restoration Tool (CLART): A geo-information based
mobile app which has helped over 18,000 villages across five states in India to manage soil and
water better;

* Treetracker: A mobile money-based app which has supported local communities plant 250,000
trees across Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya;

* Guardian bio-acoustic devices: A web platform and digital devices, backed by
artificial
intelligence and machine learning, deployed to address illegal activities in
forests across
Indonésia, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Cameroon.

Digital solutions: Ingredients for success

Our work highlights four key ingredients for digital technology to help people and
nature thrive
together successfully:


Item. 1. Co-create. Local people have a deep understanding of their environment and the challenges
they face. Their knowledge offers invaluable insight on the design of more effective
and
sustainable digital solutions. For example, the GEQ Indigenous Alliance uses hackathons to co-
design creative digital solutions directly with Indigenous communities. Involving end
users and
other key stakeholders in the design process leads to greater purchase and
long-term
sustainability of the solutions, as well as more equitable outcomes.

Item. 2. Prioritise simple and intuitive user interfaces. An engaging user interface can ensure the tool
is easy to navigate, particularly when targeting end users with limited digital or
written literacy.
For example, CLART, developed by India Observatory, translates complex data into colour-
coded maps available in local languages. Extensive research was used to ensure the tool can be
easily navigated by users with lower literacy leveis. Such solutions should also build
on local
knowledge and practices already in place. This helps to ensure they are designed in a way that
aligns with, and elevates, long-standing or traditional community activities.

Item. 3. Provide direct rewards for using the solution. Tangible benefits, such as financial incentives,
can help mobilise and secure community engagement. For example, the Treetracker mobile
application incentivises users in East África to grow and maintain trees with direct
mobile
payments. As the rewards of reforestation are not immediately felt, Fairtree circumvents
the
potential loss of engagement among end users by providing financial incentives at
regular
intervals after a new tree has been planted. This both incentivises the survival of the trees, as
well
as creating a meaningful source of income for tree caretakers.

Item. 4. Foster strong local partnerships for longer-term impact. Across all examples,
maintaining
strong local partnerships and disseminating the technology through trusted individuais in
the
community was criticai to success, facilitating faster and more sustainable buy-in. This helps to
overcome potential pushback from community members against externai actors, given that local
partners are best placed to navigate the power dynamics in each area and advocate for
the
solution. For example, in Sumatra, Indonésia, Rainforest Connection, the creator of
Guardian
devices, partnered with an established grassroots non-governmental organisation to
introduce
their solar-powered bio-acoustic monitoring devices to help protect forests from illegal
logging
or poaching. Such partnerships increase buy-in with end users, provide
context-specific
knowledge and maximises the impact of the solutions.

Encontramos fortes exemplos de comunidades que usam tecnologias digitais para gerenciar
melhor os recursos naturais. Essas soluções são diversas: desde o uso de big data para prever a
poluição do ar e restaurar manguezais, até aplicativos móveis envolventes que fornecem
melhores informações e acesso a financiamento para ajudar a população local a planejar
e
gerenciar recursos naturais, e tecnologia GPS e sensoriamento remoto para rastrear e proteger a
vida selvagem. O relatório se inspira em três estudos de caso em que as tecnologias
digitais
fizeram mudanças sociais e ambientais positivas:

* Composite Landscape Assessment and Restoration Tool (CLART): A geo-information based
mobile app which has helped over 18,000 villages across five states in India to manage soil and
water better;

* Ferramenta de Avaliação e Restauração de Paisagens Compostas (CLART): Um aplicativo
móvel baseado em geo-informação que ajudou mais de 18.000 aldeias em cinco estados da
índia a gerenciar melhor o solo e a água;


* Treetracker: A mobile money-based app which has supported local communities plant 250,000
trees across Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya;

* Rastreador de árvores: Um aplicativo móvel baseado em dinheiro que apoiou comunidades
locais a plantar 250.000 árvores em Uganda, Tanzânia e Quênia;

* Guardian bio-acoustic devices: A web platform and digital devices, backed by
artificial
intelligence and machine learning, deployed to address illegal activities in
forests across
Indonésia, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Cameroon.

* Dispositivos bioacústicos Guardiãos: Uma plataforma da Web e dispositivos digitais, apoiados
por inteligência artificial e aprendizado de máquina, implantados para lidar com
atividades
ilegais em florestas na Indonésia, Brasil, Peru, Equador e Camarões.

Digital solutions: Ingredients for success
Soluções digitais: Ingredientes para o sucesso

Our work highlights four key ingredients for digital technology to help people and
nature thrive
together successfully:

Nosso trabalho destaca quatro ingredientes principais para que a tecnologia digital
ajude as
pessoas e a natureza a prosperarem juntas com sucesso:

Item. 5. Co-create. Local people have a deep understanding of their environment and the challenges
they face. Their knowledge offers invaluable insight on the design of more effective
and
sustainable digital solutions. For example, the GEO Indigenous Alliance uses hackathons to co-
design creative digital solutions directly with Indigenous communities. Involving end
users and
other key stakeholders in the design process leads to greater purchase and
long-term
sustainability of the solutions, as well as more equitable outcomes.

Item. 5. Criar em conjunto. A população local tem um profundo conhecimento de seu ambiente e dos
desafios que enfrenta. Seu conhecimento oferece uma visão inestimável sobre o design de
soluções digitais mais eficazes e sustentáveis. Por exemplo, a Aliança Indígena GEO
utiliza
Hackathons (maratonas de programação) para co-projetar soluções digitais criativas diretamente
com as comunidades indígenas. O envolvimento dos usuários finais e de outras
partes
interessadas importantes no processo de design leva a uma maior aquisição e sustentabilidade
de longo prazo das soluções, bem como a resultados mais equitativos.

Item. 6. Prioritise simple and intuitive user interfaces. An engaging user interface can ensure the tool
is easy to navigate, particularly when targeting end users with limited digital or
written literacy.
For example, CLART, developed by India Observatory, translates complex data into colour-
coded maps available in local languages. Extensive research was used to ensure the tool can be
easily navigated by users with lower literacy leveis. Such solutions should also build
on local
knowledge and practices already in place. This helps to ensure they are designed in a way that
aligns with, and elevates, long-standing or traditional community activities.

Item. 6. Priorizar interfaces de usuário simples e intuitivas. Uma interface de usuário envolvente pode
garantir que a ferramenta seja fácil de navegar, principalmente quando se trata de usuários finais
com alfabetização digital ou escrita limitada. Por exemplo, o CLART,
desenvolvido pelo
Observatório India, traduz dados complexos em mapas com códigos de cores disponíveis nos
idiomas locais. Uma extensa pesquisa foi usada para garantir que a ferramenta possa ser
facilmente navegada por usuários com níveis mais baixos de alfabetização. Essas soluções
também devem se basear no conhecimento, e nas práticas locais já existentes. Isso
ajuda a
garantir que elas sejam projetadas de forma a se alinharem, e exaltar as atividades comunitárias
tradicionais ou de longa data.

Item. 7. Provide direct rewards for using the solution. Tangible benefits, such as financial incentives,
can help mobilise and secure community engagement. For example, the Treetracker mobile
application incentivises users in East África to grow and maintain trees with direct
mobile
payments. As the rewards of reforestation are not immediately felt, Fairtree circumvents
the
potential loss of engagement among end users by providing financial incentives at
regular
intervals after a new tree has been planted. This both incentivises the survival of the trees, as
well
as creating a meaningful source of income for tree caretakers.

Item. 7. Oferecer recompensas diretas pelo uso da solução. Benefícios tangíveis, como
incentivos
financeiros, podem ajudar a mobilizar e garantir o envolvimento da comunidade. Por exemplo, o
aplicativo móvel "Rastreador de árvores" incentiva os usuários da África Oriental a
cultivar e
manter árvores com pagamentos móveis diretos. Como as recompensas do reflorestamento não
são sentidas imediatamente, a Fairtree contorna a possível perda de engajamento entre os
usuários finais fornecendo incentivos financeiros em intervalos regulares após o plantio de uma
nova árvore. Isso incentiva a sobrevivência das árvores, além de criar uma fonte de
renda
significativa para os cuidadores de árvores.


Item. 8. Foster strong local partnerships for longer-term impact. Across all examples,
maintaining
strong local partnerships and disseminating the technology through trusted individuais in
the
community was criticai to success, facilitating faster and more sustainable buy-in. This helps to
overcome potential pushback from community members against externai actors, given that local
partners are best placed to navigate the power dynamics in each area and advocate for
the
solution. For example, in Sumatra, Indonésia, Rainforest Connection, the creator
ofGuardian

or poaching. Such partnerships increase buy-in with end users, provide
context-specific
knowledge and maximises the impact of the solutions.

solutions-to-help-people-and-nature-thrive/

Item. 8. Promover parcerias locais sólidas para obter um impacto de longo prazo. Em todos
os
exemplos, a manutenção de parcerias locais sólidas e a disseminação da tecnologia por meio de
pessoas de confiança na comunidade foram fundamentais para o sucesso, facilitando uma
adesão mais rápida e sustentável. Isso ajuda a superar a possível resistência dos membros da
comunidade em relação aos agentes externos, uma vez que os parceiros locais estão em melhor
posição para lidar com a dinâmica de poder em cada área e defender a solução. Por exemplo,
em Sumatra, na Indonésia, a Conexão de Floresta, criadora dos dispositivos Guardian, fez uma
parceria com uma organização não governamental de base estabelecida para introduzir seus
dispositivos de monitoramento bioacústico alimentados por energia solar para ajudar a proteger
as florestas contra a extração ilegal de madeira ou a caça ilegal. Essas parcerias aumentam a
adesão dos usuários finais, fornecem conhecimento específico do contexto e maximizam o
impacto das soluções.
